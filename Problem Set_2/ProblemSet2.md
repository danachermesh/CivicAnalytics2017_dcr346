# Energy Use, Income and Public Asthma Hospitalization Rates 

_Abstract_ – Demographic and environmental conditions have long been found as strongly related to asthma hospitalization and mortality rates, although most of the relevant studies focus on outdoor air quality as the primary factor affects asthma, overlooking the built environment itself as key factor in shaping public health. Today’s Energy disclosure mandate for New York City, Local Low 84 (LL84) gives an opportunity to assess the impact of building energy performance on public health, and on asthma hospitalization rates in particular. This paper examines two primarily possible relationships, the first is between Energy use and neighborhoods’ Asthma rates, while the second relationship to be included is between Income and Energy performance. The study revealed very weak, almost non-existing negative correlations between the variables, which might imply for the insufficient complexity of the models conducted or unparticular data chosen. At the last part of the study a model was developed for only children asthma rates, as well as multivariate regression that tested the strength of predicting asthma rates by considering total Energy Use and Median Household Income as independent variables. The latest analyses are still vague and / or insufficient and leave questions for a future research.
